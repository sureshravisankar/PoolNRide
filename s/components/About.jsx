						Welcome to "Pool and Ride" - the ultimate platform for drivers and
						riders to share rides and save money. Our project aims to provide a
						convenient and eco-friendly solution to the daily commute by
						enabling riders to share a ride with drivers who are headed in the
						same direction. With "Pool and Ride", drivers can offer their
						vehicles for pooling, and riders can search for available rides that
						match their routes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our platform is designed to promote carpooling, reduce traffic
						congestion, and lower carbon emissions. "Pool and Ride" is not just
						a ride-sharing platform; it's a community of people who care about
						the environment, want to save money, and enjoy the social aspect of
						sharing a ride. We believe that sharing a ride is not only a
						practical solution but also a way to build connections and create
						new friendships.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our mission is to make commuting more affordable, efficient, and
						enjoyable for everyone. Whether you're a driver looking to share
						your ride or a rider searching for a convenient and cost-effective
						way to get around, "Pool and Ride" has got you covered. Join our
						community today and start sharing your ride!
